# micycle1.github.io

A personal [website](https://micycle1.github.io) made with *blogdown* â€” an R package that creates websites from R Markdown files using Hugo. The website uses the [Even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even) theme.

When markdown files (i.e blog posts) are pushed to the *master* branch of this repository, a Github action is triggered that [builds](https://github.com/chabad360/hugo-gh-pages) the site with *Hugo* into the *gh-pages* branch; the website is served via *GitHub Pages* from there.
